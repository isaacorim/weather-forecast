## 🧪 How It Works

1. User selects a city from the dropdown.
2. JavaScript extracts coordinates and constructs the API URL.
3. Fetches forecast data from the **7Timer! API**.
4. Parses and displays:
   - Date
   - Weather description
   - Min/Max temperatures
   - Visual icon
5. Handles errors gracefully and shows feedback if data is unavailable.
